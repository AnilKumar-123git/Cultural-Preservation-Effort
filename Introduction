This GitHub project is dedicated to the Cultural Preservation and Heritage Conservation, an initiative aimed at preserving and promoting cultural heritage through digital humanities projects and heritage conservation efforts. Our mission is to safeguard cultural artifacts, traditions, and historical knowledge for future generations. Cultural preservation is a multifaceted endeavor encompassing the protection, conservation, and promotion of both tangible and intangible aspects of a society's herotage. Tangible elements include artifacts, monuments, and historical sites, while intangible components involve traditions, languages, folklore, and oral histories. The overarching goal is to safeguard cultural diversity, foster a sense of identity, and transmit knowledge across generations.
